# Issuebox
Software collaboration tool built for the purposes of the subject "Software Configuration Management" on Faculty of Technical Sciences, taught by PhD. professor Igor DejanoviÄ‡.

Want to keep track of your software project all nice and tidy? Issuebox is a right way to go. Its loose integration with Github will provide as much as it's needed for a project, while keeping your Github project page with only neccessary information.

Issuebox is mainly built around project issue as its main part. They are for the given Github repository, could be marked with certain tags and commented as well. When issue is solved, it is provided with information which git commit has solved it. Project can have as many collaborators, but only one owner.

Issuebox is easy deployable with Docker. More information could be found on its [Docker page](https://hub.docker.com/r/tim3uks/issuebox/). If you want to see it in action, you can do it on [this Issuebox instance](http://147.91.177.194:8003/website).
